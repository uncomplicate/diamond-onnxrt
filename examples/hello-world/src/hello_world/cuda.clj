;; If you see the number 7, you're ready to go.

;; If you see an exception, you should probably check your GPU drivers
;; and CUDA versions compatibility whit the CUDA binaries you use.
;; If that happens, first check your general CUDA setup by trying
;; either Neanderthal or Deep Diamond hello world. Make them work first,
;; since they are generally not that picky.
;; ONNX Runtime can be brittle regarding CUDA binaries, so deal with it
;; only when you know your system is well set.
