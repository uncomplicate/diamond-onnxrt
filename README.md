# Diamond ONNX Runtime

Diamond ONNX Runtime is is a Clojure library for running ML and AI models that integrates into [Neanderthal](https://github.com/uncomplicate/neanderthal) and [Deep Diamond](https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond).

## How to use it

Until I set up a dedicated website with the documentation and tutorials, please refer to my
blog [Dragan Rocks](https://dragan.rocks), the [Hello World example project](https://github.com/uncomplicate/diamond-onnxrt/tree/main/examples/hello-world), and detailed [Clojure tests](https://github.com/uncomplicate/diamond-onnxrt/tree/main/test/uncomplicate/diamond).

There is not only enough step-by-step material there to get you started, but to deep-dive into both higher-level and lower-level features.

Please note that this library does not even introduce much public API, beyond the onnx function, since it neatly blends into [Neanderthal](https://github.com/uncomplicate/neanderthal) and [Deep Diamond](https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond), which is very extensively documented in the [Deep Learning for Programmers](https://aiprobook.com) book.
